TASK-3-IOT-SECURITY-SYSTEM

COMPANY:CODTECH IT SOLUTION

NAME:V.DHANUSHIYA

INTERN ID: CT04DH2000

DOMAIN:INTERNET OF THINGS

DURATION:4 WEEKS

MENTOR:NEELA SANTHOSH

This project is part of the CodTech IoT Internship. Task 3 focuses on building a basic security system that detects motion using a PIR sensor and responds with an alert signal (LED in this simulation).

Project Description
A simple IoT-based motion detection system using:

PIR sensor to detect human movement

LED to simulate an alarm or alert

Serial Monitor to display motion messages

Built and tested using Tinkercad Circuits

Note: This is a simulated prototype for learning purposes and does not include real image capture or mobile push alerts (which require external platforms like Blynk or ESP32-CAM).

Components Used
Component	Quantity
Arduino UNO	1
PIR Motion Sensor	1
LED (Red - Alarm)	1
